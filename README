version 0.6.3: 20.5.2008

- adimpro now writes temporary files into the directory used by function tempfile()
- corrected handling (identification)  of greyvalue images in read.image 


version 0.6.1: 14.5.2008

this version incorporates several new features from the development version

Input/Output:

- we now keep exif information as comment of an image 
  this information is evaluated to recover the original adimpro-object
  used to produce the image file, see demo(io).
  This may be changed to using rpm-profiles.
- new function write.raw provides a possibility to store 
  RAW sensor data as a greyscale png-image
  these images are recognized by read.raw, see demo(raw).
- write.image now keeps color space by default
- read.image/write.image now also handles xyz, yuv, yiq and 
  hsi color spaces correctly
- the location of ImageMagick is now automatically determined 
  using function Sys.which and set as an environment variable 
  ImageMagick when the package is loaded (This requires R >=2.6.0). 
  The argument convert.path in read.image and write.image is no 
  longer needed and has been removed.
- make.image no longer has an argument gamma


Adaptive smoothing:

- functions awsimage, awspimage:

- value of ladjust      1.0 -- 1.25, different lseq
- new arguments plateau=NULL, homogen=TRUE, earlystop=TRUE
- new varmodel "Quadratic"
- location kernel with choice "Plateau"
- statistical kernel changed to Plateau with spmin=0.25
- FORTRAN subroutine awsimg has fewer parameters
- lseq extended (if it is to short) by last element rather than by 1 
- FORTRAN subroutine awsvimage has differing parameters
- FORTRAN subroutine mawsimg has fewer parameters
- FORTRAN subroutine awspimg has fewer parameters
- handles lower/uppercase for some arguments

- new function awsprop for testing propagation condition

- new function awsaniso for anisotropic structural adaptive smoothing

Color space conversions: 

- increased and changed functionality of adjust.image
- rgb2xxx  also accepts colorspaces xyz , yuv and yiq
- xxx2rgb - functions now allow to specify RGB-color space (default "Adobe")
- new function cam2rgb for conversion of camera color spaces to RGB
- new funcions rgb2xyzmat and xyz2rgbmat 
- function gamma.correction  now uses gammatype instead of arguments ga and bp
- new function for inverse gamma correction
- new function whitepoint, wpofT, changewhitepoint  for white point definitions and manipulation
- whitebalance no uses whitepoint and color temperature 
- adjust.image  now allows to set gammatype, cspace, whitep, color temperature blackpoint and exposure
- new function demosaic.raw to convert RAW sensor data to RGB


Image manipulations and diagnostics:

- function edges has a new argument abs
- functions shrink.image, rotate.image, clip.image also accept "RAW"
- rotate.image has new argument compress
- new function extract.info for extracting EXIF-Information

Bug fixes: e.g. in make.image, invgamma.correction (internal),
           read.ppm(internal), read.pgm(internal),

Demos:

We added an extensive set of demos. 
demo(adimpro) just runs all demos sequentially. Especially
demo(awspimage) (local polynomial smoothing) is time consuming.

version 0.4.6: 16.4.2008

estimation of local anisotropy
visualization of local anisotropy
